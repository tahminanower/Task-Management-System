Introduction
Welcome to the user manual of the Task Management System (TMS), a Java-based application designed to simplify and streamline your task organization. The TMS is a command-line tool that empowers users to define, query, and modify both simple primitive and composite tasks efficiently. The primary goal of the TMS is to facilitate task management by allowing users to create, edit, and delete tasks. A task can either be a primitive task, representing the smallest units of work, or a composite task, which is a collection of other tasks.
